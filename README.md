# PDF Content Extraction and Q&A System

## Overview

This project is a PDF content extraction and question-answering system that leverages Google Generative AI models to process and answer questions based on the content of PDF documents. The system is built using a combination of Google Colab, Flask, and various Python libraries.

### Key Features:
- Extracts and processes text from PDF documents.
- Splits text into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
- Uses generative AI models to create embeddings and answer questions.
- Provides a web interface for users to upload PDFs and query the system.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-qna-system.git
   cd pdf-qna-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

Add the following packages to your `requirements.txt`:

```
google-generativeai
langchain-google-genai
chromadb
pypdf
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-text-splitters
flask
flask-ngrok
requests
```

## Usage

### Running the Flask Front-End

1. **Navigate to the Flask Directory**

   ```bash
   cd flask_front_end
   ```

2. **Start the Flask Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open Your Web Browser**

   - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web interface where you can upload PDFs and enter prompts.

### Configuring Colab Integration

1. **Upload the Notebook**

   - Download the `.ipynb` file from Google Colab and upload it to your local environment or run it directly in Colab.

2. **Expose the Notebook as an API**

   - Use tools like `flask-ngrok` in Colab to create a public endpoint.
   - Update the `url` variable in `app.py` with the ngrok URL.

### Example Prompt and Response

- **Prompt**: "What is machine learning?"
- **Response**: The system will provide a concise and relevant answer based on the content of the uploaded PDF document.
